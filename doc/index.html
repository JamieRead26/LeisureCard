                <h1  class="page-header">Dependency Injection</h1>

                <p><a href="http://structuremap.github.io/">Structure Map</a> is used for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">Dependency Injection</a>.
                    <code>GRG.Bonusbond.Web.Bootstrap</code> implements the <a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2014/06/01/how-to-refactor-for-dependency-injection.aspx">Composition Root</a> pattern
                    and intializes the container with all dependencies.</p>

                <p>The <a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2014/06/01/how-to-refactor-for-dependency-injection.aspx">Composition Root</a> pattern described above has the
                    advantage of reducing the required references to <a href="http://structuremap.github.io/">Structure Map</a> and the (debatable) disadvantage of centralising the configuration.
                    The other option is to delegate the configuration of the container local to the concrete types.  A full discussion
                    of the merits of either approach is beyond the scope of this document.</p>

                <p>Once a type is correctly configured in the container it can be added to MVC controllers constructors and domain model service constructors.
                    Typically only <code>Service</code> interfaces will be passed to controller constructors.  MVC controllers should simply map the view models to the domain
                    logic as encapsulated in the <a href="#service">Service Layer</a>.  This enables all business logic to be unit and integration tested from the service layer
                    API without the need to go through the web stack.</p>

                <p>Service constructors will reference the <a href="#database-orm">repositories</a> as well as other <a href="#downstream">downstream dependencies</a>.
                    This enables the controllers to be unit tested by mocking those dependencies at test time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="bs-docs-section" id="database">
                <h1  class="page-header">Database</h1>

                <p>Bonusbond employs a code first model using <a href="http://www.fluentnhibernate.org/">FluentNHibernate</a>.</p>

                <h3 id="database-schema">Schema Management</h3>

                <p><a href="http://www.fluentnhibernate.org/">FluentNHibernate</a> is used to manage the database schema as well as access
                    data at runtime.  FluentNHibernate provides a fluent API for specifying metadata relating entities that FluentNHibernate can then use to generate the schema on the target database.</p>

                <p>By avoiding the use of stored procedures and DB platform specific features the BBO application is DB platform agnostic and at time of writing has been demonstrated to run on both
                    MSSQL and PostGres.</p>

                <p>The schema that is generated by FluentNHibernate is determined by the ClassMaps (see <code>GRG.Bonusbond.Repository.ClassMaps</code>).
                    The <code>SessionFactoryBuilder</code> is responsible for generating the schema on the target DB instance and it does this by dropping and recreating
                    the schema each time.  The <code>SessionFactoryBuilder</code> is called by the SchemaReset command line tool and by integration test setup code.</p>

                <p>The <code>GRG.SchemaReset</code> project contains the SchemaReset console application.  Executing this tool with no arguments
                    will reset the target DB schema of the database specified in the app.config.  This should be done each
                    time either the data model is changed locally or as a result of remote code changes being pulled into a dev environment.</p>

                <h3 id="database-data">Data Creation</h3>

                <p>Data falls into two categories;</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Static Data</b>; such as resources.</li>
                    <li><b>Test Data</b>; to facilitate integration tests.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In the Data solution folder there are 3 projects;</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>GRG.Bonusbond.Data</b>: contains the abstract base class <code>DataFixture</code>.  A <code>DataFixture</code> is responsible for
                        populating one type of entity in the database, e.g. <code>User</code>.  A data fixture may depend on <i>n</i> other <code>DataFixture</code>s being
                        run before it is run in order for data to exist that is then referenced.  In addition a <code>DataFixture</code>, when executed, can
                        obtain a reference to another <code>DataFixture</code> and in that way refer to known persisted entities without having to perform database queries via the repository classes
                        (described in detail further on).
                        Inspect the <code>RoleFixture</code> and <code>UserFixture</code> classes that do exactly this in order to create the <code>Role</code> and <code>User</code> records.</li>
                    <li><b>GRG.Bonusbond.Data.Static</b>: contains <code>DataFixture</code> implementations for static data.</li>
                    <li><b>GRG.Bonusbond.Data.Test</b>: contains <code>DataFixture</code> implementations for test data.</li>
                    <li><b>GRG.SchemaReset</b>: A command line tool that serves two functions, 1) reset the target database schema and 2) execute data fixtures to populate the database.</li>
                </ul>

                <code>DataFixtures</code>'s form a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">Directed Acyclic Graph</a> in which a single <code>DataFixture</code> may depend on 0..N
                <code>DataFixtures</code>'s and circular references are illegal. This is a useful property as it allows the <code>DataFixtures</code>'s to be run with a varying degree of concurrency
                depending on the nature of the graph.  At the time of writing there are three <code>DataFixture</code>'s with no dependencies and one <code>DataFixtures</code> with one dependency.  This
                means three can run run concurrently and one sequentially post it's dependency.  This reduces the execution time of data population proportionate to the number of fixtures and records.
                <a href="https://github.com/myles-mcdonnell/MPM.PDAG">MPM.PDAG</a> is a general purpose component library for building a executing DAG's and is referenced by SchemaReset
                <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/MPM.PDAG/">via a NuGet package.</a></p>

                <p>SchemaReset loads <code>DataFixtures</code>'s by reflecting over <i>n</i> assemblies.  The list of assemblies to reflect over is passed via command line args.
                    e.g. <code>SchemaReset.exe GRG.Bonusbond.Data.Static GRG.Bonusbond.Data.Test</code> will reset the target DB schema and execute all <code>DataFixtures</code>'s defined
                    in those two assemblies.  The assemblies must be available to the SchemeReset process at runtime of course and the target DB connection configuration is defined in the SchemaReset.exe configuration file.</p>

                <h3 id="database-orm">Object Relational Mapping</h3>

                <p>Data access is achieved via the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html">Repository Pattern</a>.
                    A <code>Repository</code> generally has 1 to 1 affinity with an entity.  In order to implement a new repository first create an interface for the repository, such as
                    <code>GRG.Bonusbond.DomainModel.Repository.IUserRepository</code> that implements <code>IRepository&lt;TEntity&gt;</code> where in this case
                    <code>TEntity</code> is <code>User</code>. Next create a concrete implementation of the interface, e.g.
                    <code>GRG.Bonusbond.Repository.UserRepository</code> which inherits the abstract base <code>Repository&lt;TEntity&gt;</code> and implements the entity
                    specific interface defined in the previous step, e.g. <code>GRG.Bonusbond.DomainModel.Repository.IUserRepository</code>.  At this point a repository that can CRUD that
                    entity exists (the CRUD methods are in <code>Repository&lt;TEntity&gt;</code>) and this should be added to the <a href="#di">DI container</a>. As methods for reading and manipulating
                    entities are required they should be implemented in the concrete repository for that entity type using the following pattern:

                <pre>
public IEnumerable GetByName(string name)
{
    using (var session = SessionFactory.OpenSession())
    {
        session.Query&lt;TEntity&gt;.Where(e=>e.Name == name).ToArray();
    }
}</pre>

                <p>Note the importance of calling <code>.ToArray()</code> as this forces the LINQ query to execute before the session is disposed.
                    Failure to do this will result in session closed errors when the resulting enumeration is enumerated.</p>

                <p>Also note that when multiple operations must by executed within a transaction the pattern is as follows: </p>

                <pre>
using (var session = SessionFactory.OpenSession())
using (var transaction = session.BeginTransaction())
{
    ... perform multiple ops on session..

    transaction.Commit(); //Will implicitly rollback in the event of an exception
} </pre>

                <p>Furthermore, and this is the exception to the 1 to 1 entity affinity of repositories, a repository may encapsulate operations on multiple entity types a a single transaction.
                In which case it should be fairly obvious in which repository the logic should reside.  E.G. A shopping basket repository may contain a <code>ProcessOrder(..)</code> method which
                would persist an Order entity and clear the basket in a single transaction.</p>

                <p>Note that <code>GRG.Bonusbond.DomainModel</code> contains only the repository interfaces and the entity classes which are very strictly DTOs/POCOs.  This enables
                    consumers to reference only this assembly and have the <code>GRG.Bonusbond.Repository</code> concrete implementation injected at runtime
                    via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control">IoC</a> keeping the solution dependency graph clean(er).</p>

                <h3 id="database-uow">Unit Of Work</h3>

                <p>In order to maintain consistency a unit of work implementation has been introduced that enables transactions to encompass any number of data operations
                across any number of repositories. <p>

                <h4 id="database-uow-usage">Usage</h4>
                <p>When calling a repository method that method will implicitly execute within the context of a transaction and is therefore atomic.
                When a transaction that spans multiple repository methods, either on the same repository or multiple repositories, the <code>UnitOfWork</code> is applied the method of the service that
                coordinates the operations.</p>

                <h4 id="database-uow-impl">Implementation</h4>
                <p>The Unit of Work implementation follows this example
                <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/543810/Dependency-Injection-and-Unit-Of-Work-using-Castle">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/543810/Dependency-Injection-and-Unit-Of-Work-using-Castle</a>
                with the exception that BBO uses <a href="http://structuremap.github.io/">StructureMap</a> for DI and this example uses Castle.Windsor.  The <code>GRG.Bonusbond.UnitOfWork</code> project defines the <code>UnitOfWorkInterceptor</code> which
                is responsible for transaction scoping.  It also contains a <code>RepositoryFactory</code> that is simply a helper class for creating intercepted repositories outside of the structure map container, as
                is the case for integration tests and SchemaReset tool.  e.g:</p>

                <pre>
    public override void Execute(Func&gt;Type, DataFixture&lt; getDataFixture, ISessionFactory sessionFactory)
    {
        var resourceRepository = RepositoryFactory.Build&gt;IResourceRepository&lt;(new ResourceRepository(), sessionFactory);

        foreach (var resource in resourceData)
            resourceRepository.Persist(resource);
    }</pre>

                <p>N.B. A quirk here is that the interface of the repository must be specified as the type argument for the build method.  The code will compile if it is not but a runtime error
                will be throw from <code>Castle.DynamicProxy</code> when the method is called.</p>

                <p>Take a look at the <code>GRG.Bonusbond.Web.bootstrap</code> class and notice that all services and repositories have the interceptor specified like so:</p>

                <pre>
    ...

_.For<IUserAccountService>()
    .LifecycleIs<HttpContextLifecycle>()
    .Use<UserAccountService>()
    .InterceptWith(
        new FuncInterceptor<IUserAccountService>(
            service =>
            proxyGenerator.CreateInterfaceProxyWithTarget(service,  unitOfWorkInterceptor)));

    ...</pre>

                <p>If any repositories are not defined as above a null reference exception will occur when the repository is call and tries to access the database session.</p>


            </div>

            <div class="bs-docs-section" id="service">
                <h1 class="page-header">Service Layer</h1>

                <p><code>GRG.Bonusbond.Service</code> implements the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/serviceLayer.html">Service Layer</a> pattern.
                    A full discussion of <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/serviceLayer.html">Service Layer</a> is beyond the scope of this document but in short it also provides
                    a home for all domain logic and enables this domain logic to be unit tested and integration tested without involving the UI layer.  MVC controllers
                    should be thin and only responsible for UI rendering and mapping to the domain logic as encapsulated by the services.  One caveat here is that in the case of BBO
                    the decision has been taken that it is acceptable for controllers to access repositories directly.  A pure service layer dictates that the controller would only access services
                    which in turn would access repositories.  Given the simple nature of much of the BBO behaviour a pragmatic approach of allowing both models is acceptable.  Where complex logic that
                    involves orchestration between multiple elements is required, such as remote API's and repositories, this logic should exist in service methods.</p>

                <P>A concrete service and it's interface exist in the same file.  Once a service is defined it should be added to the DI container via <code>GRG.Bonusbond.Web.Bootstrap</code>.</P>

                <p><b>N.B.</b> All service method arguments and return types are defined in the <code>GRG.Bonusbond.DomainModel</code> project.</p>

                <p>Stand alone reusable business logic should be coded into it's own class under the BusinessLogic folder, e.g. <code>PasswordValidationLogic</code>.</p>

                <h3 class="page-header" id="model">Domain Model</h3>

                <p><code>GRG.Bonusbond.DomainModel</code> contains the POCO's that model the BBO domain along with the service interfaces.  This makes the library ultra portable as it only references
                    two .NET framework libraries and no packages.  This is a very deliberate design decision.  Any references and logic required to map these types to other domains/concerns
                    is the responsibility of the code that implements those domains/concerns and should exist there and not in the model itself.<p>

                <p>Where data that is exposed by types that are part of downstream dependencies these types should be mapped the model classes in the service layer.
                    <a href="http://valueinjecter.codeplex.com/">ValueInjecter</a> is currently part of the project as a PoC with the goal of reducing mapping code.</p>

                <p><b>N.B.</b> All service method arguments and return types are defined in the <code>GRG.Bonusbond.Model</code> project.</p>

                <h3 class="page-header" id="domainmapping">Domain Mapping</h3>

                <p>Service classes interact with various downstream dependencies such as remote API's and the data storage layer.  It is critical for reasons of code maintenance, testability,
                    re-usability and dependency management that the service layer is not polluted by exposing these types via it's public API.  This often requires that downstream types be mapped
                    to their <code>GRG.Bonusbond.DomainModel</code> equivalents. <a href="http://valueinjecter.codeplex.com/">ValueInjecter</a> is being used to assist with this task.  The established pattern
                    is to create an extension class in <code>GRG.Bonusbond.Service.MappingExtensions</code> for each type that needs to be mapped and add methods for each direction required.  For
                    an example look at <code>GRG.Bonusbond.Service.MappingExtensions.UserMapper</code> which maps the <code>GRG.Bonusbond.DomainModel.User</code> to the <code>GRG.Bonusbond.DataModel.User</code>
                    and vice-versa.  Also refer to the <code>GRG.Bonusbond.Service.UserAccountService.FindbyId(..)</code> method to see how this extension is employed.</p>

                <h3 class="page-header" id="serviceconfiguration">Configuration</h3>

                <p>A number of the services require configuration data, such as the <code>UserAccountService</code> with needs a from email address for the registration emails.
                One common pattern for configuring modules is to define a <Code>ConfigurationSectionHandler</Code> that will dictate an XML schema for configuration and take care
                of parsing that section in app.config files.  That approach is verbose in the case of BBO and makes unit testing more convoluted. <code>GRG.Bonusbond.Service.ServiceConfig</code> is a POCO
                    with properties for the config data required by the services.  <code>GRG.Bonusbond.Web.Bootstrap</code> creates the <code>GRG.Bonusbond.Service.ServiceConfig</code> instance,
                    populates the required values from web.config and adds the <code>GRG.Bonusbond.Service.ServiceConfig</code> instance to the DI container so that services can simply specify it as a constructor argument.
                </p>

            <div class="bs-docs-section" id="downstream">
                <h1 class="page-header">Downstream Dependencies</h1>

                <p>Downstream dependencies in the case of BBO are the remote API's; Mandrake, GO2 and MVB.</p>

                <p>To enable BBO development to move forward as these API's evolve to meet the new requirements for BBO, for each remote API
                    there are three projects;</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Contract</b>; an interface and DTOs.</li>
                    <li><b>Mock</b>; a concrete mock used to support development of BBO functionality dependent on pending API changes.</li>
                    <li><b>Client</b>; a client for the actual remote API.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Only the service layer will reference the API contracts, enabling the services to be unit tested and protecting the rest of the application
                    from API's changes that require changes to the contract.</p>

                <h3 id="testing-unit">Unit Tests</h3>
                <p>For the purpose of Bonusbond a unit test is defined as a self contained test that does not execute any code that crosses a process boundary.
                    This may be a single method of a single class or it may involve collaboration between multiple classes/methods, but never make calls that go out of process.</p>

                <p>Unit tests reside in unit test projects which have a 1 to 1 affinity with the project/module containing the classes/functionality being tested.</p>

                <h3 id="testing-int">Integration Tests</h3>
                <p>For the purpose of Bonusbond an integration test is defined as a test that executes code across <i>n</i> process boundaries, such as remote API's or database calls.
                Integration may use a composition of mocks and concrete dependencies.</p>

                <p>Currently integration tests exist at the repository and service layer levels.</p>
