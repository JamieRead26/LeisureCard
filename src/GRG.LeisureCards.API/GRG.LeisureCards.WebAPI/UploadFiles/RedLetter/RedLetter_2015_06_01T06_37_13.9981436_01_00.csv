Following a discussion on the aircraft and flight safety, board a dual-controlled glider with an instructor ready for take-off.

Revel in the amazing views of the rolling countryside below and during the flight (at the discretion of the pilot), take charge of the controls to truly enjoy the unrivalled joys of flying.</WhatsIncluded>

    <WhatsIncluded>Enjoy the peace and tranquillity of an aerotow gliding flight in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. Kick off with a full flight safety briefing before jumping aboard a dual-controlled glider with an expert pilot. Once ready, the glider is towed into the air by a light aircraft, and when at an altitude of approximately 2,000 ft, the rope is dropped and the aircraft is free to elegantly roam the skies using thermal currents. Enjoy sensational birds-eye views of the Chilterns below and during the flight (at the pilot's discretion), there may be a chance to take over the controls and become an honorary pilot.</WhatsIncluded>
    <Availability>Seven days a week throughout the year, including bank holidays. The club is closed during the Christmas period. Weekends are particularly busy - book at least six weeks in advance. Bookings are more likely to be available on weekdays and weekday evenings.</Availability>

    <Duration>The length of glider flights depends entirely on the prevailing thermals (currents of warmer air that provide the lift). As a guide, the aerotow flight should last for between 12 and 20 minutes.</Duration>
    <ShortDuration>15 mins</ShortDuration>
    <HowManyPeople>The centre works on the ratio of one instructor to two pupils.</HowManyPeople>
