#Leisure Cards

The Leisure Card system consists of 2 web applications, one serves the API and the other serves the UI.  The UI is implemented using AngularJS and interacts with the API. 

In addition there is a .NET client library for the API here: https://github.com/ShiftkeySoftware/GRG.LeisureCards/tree/Integration/src/GRG.LeisureCards.API/GRG.LeisureCards.WebAPI.Client.
